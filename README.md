# Water_Measure
Measure water - regression

3 sets of data
 1 - received as exel spread cheet
 2 - extracted from image
 3 - pictures taken

Second data consists of 2 sets (7 points per set - 0, 0.1, 1, 4, 10, 20, 30) for training and 1 set for testing.
The curve trained with second data set is..
W2*H^2 + W1*H + b
(W2=95.731644, W1=71.404472, b=-1.093507) - now applied to android app.


I have to modify the curve: add new feature - constant 0% value.
